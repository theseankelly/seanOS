Welcome to seanOS!

The source code contained in this repository is a hobby OS developed by Sean Kelly.

The scope of the project is simply to learn more about the implementation of operating systems.

In order to build this system, you'll need a valid x86-elf cross compiler set up on your system.
Instructions to do so can be found at http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler.  The makefile should be updated
appropriately.
